# Automated-RMSF-calculation-in-VMD-
This script automates the calculation of Root Mean Square Fluctuations (RMSF) for the C-alpha (CA) atoms of specified systems using VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics). It is designed for systems with molecular dynamics trajectories and structures in GRO and XTC formats, respectively.
